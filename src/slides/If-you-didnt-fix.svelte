      Check the program yourself, have someone else check it for you,
      or walk through it with someone else.
      Run the same triangulation test cases you used to diagnose the problem
      to make sure that all aspects of the problem have been resolved.
      If you’ve solved only part of the problem, you’ll find out that you still have work to do.
      Rerun the whole program to check for side effects of your changes.
      The easiest and most effective way to check for side effects is to run the test suite.
