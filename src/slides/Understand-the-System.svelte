      The best way to make your life difficult and damage the quality of your program is to fix problems without really understanding them.
      Before you fix a problem, make sure you understand the system to the core.
      Triangulate the defect both with cases that should reproduce the error
      and with cases that shouldnâ€™t reproduce the error.
      Keep at it until you understand the problem well enough to predict its occurrence correctly every time.

  <h2>Read the manual</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Working knowledge</li>
      <li>How it's designed?</li>
      <li>Why it was designed?</li>
      </ul>
  <aside class="notes">
    You need a working knowledge of what the system is supposed to do,
    how it's designed and in some cases, why it was designed that way.
    If you don't understand some part of the system , that always seems to
    be where the problem is.

    Your debugging tools are your eyes and ears into the system:
    you have to be able to choose the right tool
    use the tool correctly
    and intepret the results you get properly
    You also have to know the limitations of your tools
