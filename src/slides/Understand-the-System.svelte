      The best way to make your life difficult and damage the quality of your program is to fix problems without really understanding them.
      Before you fix a problem, make sure you understand the system to the core.
      Triangulate the defect both with cases that should reproduce the error
      and with cases that shouldnâ€™t reproduce the error.
      Keep at it until you understand the problem well enough to predict its occurrence correctly every time.
