    <p>Take a break from the problem</p>
    <aside class="notes">
      Sometimes you concentrate so hard you can’t think. How many times have you
      paused for a cup of coffee and figured out the problem on your way to the
      coffee machine? Or in the middle of lunch? Or on the way home? Or in the
      shower the next morning? If you’re debugging and making no progress, once
      you’ve tried all the options, let it rest. Go for a walk. Work on
      something else. Go home for the day. Let your subconscious mind tease a
      solution out of the problem. The auxiliary benefit of giving up
      temporarily is that it reduces the anxiety associated with debugging. The
      onset of anxiety is a clear sign that it’s time to take a break.

      Some people call this “confessional debugging.” You often discover your
      own defect in the act of explaining it to another person.
